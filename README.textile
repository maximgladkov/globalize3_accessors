h1. Globalize3 Accessors

h2. Introduction

Generator of easy accessor methods for models using "Globalize3":http://github.com/svenfuchs/globalize3.

Use globalize_accessors with list of translated fields you want easy access to and extra :locales array listing locales for which you want the accessors to be generated.

This way a single form can be used to edit given model fields with all anticipated translations.


h2. Installation

Add this line to Gemfile:

    gem "globalize3_accessors", :git => 'git://github.com/tomash/globalize3_accessors.git'

h2. Example

Definition like this:

    class Product
      translates :title, :description
      globalize_accessors :pl, :en, :de
    end

Gives you methods: title_pl, title_en, title_de, title_pl=, title_en=, title_de= (and similar set of description_* methods). And they work seamlessly with Globalize3 (not even touching the "core" title, title= methods used by Globalize3 itself).

h2. TODO

* Make it work with full-blown locales including dash character (minus sign) like en-US, en-GB, pl-PL etc.
